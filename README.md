# k3s Setup and Configuration on Ubuntu 22.04
## Introduction
We will be using a virtual machine with operating system _Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS_, kernel _GNU/Linux 5.15.0-73-generic_, and architecture _x86-64_ to setup and configure a Kubernetes cluster using the [k3s distribution](https://docs.k3s.io/). We'll go with a K3s single-server setup (we might expand at a later date).        
![K3s Single Server Setup](/public/assets/images/k3s-architecture.png "K3s Single Server Setup")   

The ultimate goal for having this cluster up and running is to administer and orchestrate the [Gen3 stack](https://gen3.org/resources/operator/index.html), which consists of over a dozen containerised microservices.   

## Installation
### K3s
The installation script for K3s, with default load balancer `servicelb` (also known as `klipper`) and default ingress controller `traefik` can be used as follows:
```bash
sudo curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```
The installation includes additional utilities such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `ctr`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`. `kubectl` will automatically use the `kubeconfig` file that gets written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` after the installation. By default, the container runtime that K3s uses is `containerd`.    

Docker is not needed, but can be installed if desired. To use Docker as the container runtime, the following command should be run:
```bash
curl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/20.10.sh | sh
```
This will let K3s use Docker instead of Containerd.   

However, if we wish to use a different load balancer or different ingress controller, then the default ones can be disabled when running the installation script:
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--disable servicelb --disable traefik" sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
```
In our case, we'd like to use the [metallb load balancer](https://metallb.universe.tf/) and the [nginx ingress controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/).   

We might encounter some permissions issues when trying to use the `kubectl` command line tool. This can be resolved by running the following commands:
```bash
mkdir ~/.kube
sudo k3s kubectl config view --raw | tee ~/.kube/config
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```
For these updates to persist upon reboot, the `.profile` and `.bashrc` files should be updated with `export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config`.   

After about a minute or so, the following command can be run to see if the cluster is in good shape:
```bash
kubectl get all -n kube-system
```
![Resources in kube-system Namespace](/public/assets/images/kube-system-resources.png "Resources in kube-system Namespace")   

If something is not quite right and there is a desire to re-install K3s with some other features enabled/disabled, it can be fully uninstalled with:
```bash
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```
In such a xase, remember to delete the `.kube` directory so that there aren't any certificate issues with a fresh re-install.   

### Helm
[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows for the installation or deployment of applications onto a Kubernetes cluster. We can install it as follows:
```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```
To see if Helm has been installed, we can run a simple `helm` command like:
```bash
helm list
```
and we should get an empty table as our output,
| NAME          | NAMESPACE | REVISION  | UPDATED | STATUS  | CHART | APP VERSION |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
|               |           |           |         |         |       |             |

### Installing Gen3 Microservices with Helm
The Helm charts for the Gen3 services can be found in the [uc-cdis/gen3-helm repository](https://github.com/uc-cdis/gen3-helm.git). We'd like to add the Gen3 Helm chart repository. To do this, we run:  

```bash
helm repo add gen3 http://helm.gen3.org
helm repo update
```
The Gen3 Helm chart repository contains the templates for all the microservices making up the Gen3 stack. For the `elastic-search-deployment` to run in a Linux host machine, we need to increase the max virtual memory areas by running:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
``` 
This setting will only last for the duration of the session. The host machine will be reset to the original value if it gets rebooted. For this change to be set permanently on the host machine, the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file needs to be edited with `vm.max_map_count=262144`. To see the current value, run `/sbin/sysctl vm.max_map_count`. More details can be found on the [official Elasticsearch website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).   

Some of the microservices require the `uwsgi-plugin` for Python 3. To install it, run the following:
```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install uwsgi-plugin-python3 
```

Before performing a `helm install`, we need to create a `values.yaml` file that can be used to override default values specified in the Gen3 Helm templates. The Helm installation can begin by running:
```bash
helm upgrade --install gen3-dev gen3/gen3 -f gen3/values.yaml 
```
In the above command, `gen3-dev` is the name of the release of the helm deployment. If the installation is successful, then a message similar to the following should be displayed in the terminal:
```bash
NAME: gen3-dev
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Nov 14 13:27:49 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
```
If all went well, we should see the `revproxy-dev` deployment up and running with the following command:
```bash
kubectl get ingress
```
The output should look similar to this:
| NAME          | CLASS   | HOSTS           | ADDRESS        | PORTS   | AGE |
| ------------- | ------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------- | --- |
| revproxy-dev  | traefik | gen3local.co.za | 146.141.240.78 | 80, 443 | 34s |

The list of deployments can be seen by running:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

As can be seen in the screenshot above, not all of the deployments are ready. We need to investigate why this is the case.
